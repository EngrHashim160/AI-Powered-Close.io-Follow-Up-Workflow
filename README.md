## üîÑ Workflow Logic

1. **Trigger**:  
   - Webhook listens for "Follow-Up" task completion events from Close.io.

2. **Lead Data Retrieval**:  
   - Get lead info (`/lead/{id}`)  
   - Get contacts linked to the lead (`/contact`)  
   - Get opportunity details (`/opportunity`)  
   - Get last 50 communications (email, SMS, replies)

3. **Data Merging & Prompt Creation** (`Code - Merge Lead Data`):  
   - Combines contact, opportunity, and communications data  
   - Detects preferred channel (Email/SMS) based on history  
   - Prepares an enhanced AI prompt with all details

4. **AI Processing** (`OpenAI`):  
   - Generates a JSON response with:
     ```json
     {
       "recommended_channel": "SMS" or "Email",
       "message": "Follow-up message",
       "reasoning": "Why this channel was chosen"
     }
     ```

5. **Response Parsing** (`Code - Process AI Response`):  
   - Extracts message, reasoning, and channel choice from AI output

6. **Routing** (`If - Route by Channel`):  
   - If **Email** ‚Üí Send via Close.io email API  
   - If **SMS** ‚Üí Send via Close.io SMS API
